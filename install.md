#Ansible

##What is Ansible

Suppose you have a web application and you would like to deploy it. You might think Heroku. Which in some cases
would work fine assuming your application is rather simple. But what happens when you have alot of traffic
or need a database along with a reverse proxy server and load balancer? This is where Ansible comes in. Using Ansible, orchestrating
complex deployments becomes easy along with much more. Ansible is a radically simple IT automation engine that automates cloud provisioning, configuration management, application deployment, intra-service orchestration, and many other IT needs.
